narob is weather station and ET prediction software for drag racing.
It currently works with the Altronics Performaire weather station.
In-lanes paging can be setup if the PC running it has an internet connection.
I use my phone as a hotspot.
It uses email-to-text addresses based on the service provider of the recieving phone.
